\indent Tennis matches often exhibit dramatic shifts in performance, commonly attributed to ``momentum.'' This paper develops a comprehensive framework to quantify, validate, and predict momentum in professional tennis. We propose a \textbf{Dynamic Momentum Score (DMS)} model inspired by ELO rating systems, which captures match flow by incorporating serve advantage (calibrated from data: 67.31\% serve win rate), key point weighting, streak bonuses, and natural decay. Applied to 31 matches (7,284 points) from the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, our model achieves \textbf{90.3\%} accuracy in predicting match winners based on average momentum.

To validate momentum as a real phenomenon, we employ three statistical tests: the runs test, conditional probability analysis, and chi-square test. Results strongly reject the null hypothesis of randomness, showing that winning probability after a previous win (54.4\%) significantly exceeds baseline probability (51.0\%), with $p < 0.001$.

For momentum shift prediction, we develop a \textbf{Random Forest classifier} achieving AUC of \textbf{0.945}. Feature importance analysis reveals that current momentum state, rally count, and point difference are the strongest predictors. Leave-one-match-out cross-validation confirms robust generalization with AUC of 0.941.

Sensitivity analysis demonstrates model robustness across parameter variations, with serve advantage being the most influential parameter. We conclude with practical recommendations for coaches on managing momentum during critical match situations.

Tennis matches frequently exhibit dramatic performance swings, traditionally attributed to ``momentum,'' yet the quantification of this phenomenon remains elusive. This paper develops a comprehensive \textbf{Dynamic Momentum Score (DMS)} framework to identify, validate, and predict match flow. We integrate point-level micro-data from the 2023 Wimbledon Championships (7,284 points) to construct a recursive scoring system, employ non-parametric statistical tests for validation, and build an ensemble learning pipeline to anticipate momentum shifts.

To quantify the match flow, we established the \textbf{Dynamic Momen-
tum Score （DMS） model based on ELO-rating principles}. The model innovatively incorporates a serve-advantage calibration (weighted by the observed \textbf{67.31\%} serve win rate), key-point multipliers (break points and game points), and a time-decay mechanism to reflect the volatility of psychological states. By processing 31 professional matches, the model effectively transformed discrete point outcomes into continuous momentum trajectories. The results indicate that the average DMS achieves a \textbf{90.3\% accuracy} in predicting the ultimate match winner.

To verify whether momentum is a physical reality rather than a random walk, we conducted a rigorous \textbf{statistical validation suite}. This includes the \textbf{Runs Test} to detect non-random sequences, and a \textbf{Conditional Probability Analysis} to compare winning streaks against baseline expectations. The data-driven analysis reveals that a player's winning probability after a successful point rises to \textbf{54.4\%}, which significantly exceeds the baseline win rate of \textbf{51.0\%} ($p < 0.001$). These findings provide robust evidence that momentum is a \textbf{statistically significant, non-random phenomenon} in elite tennis.

For predicting momentum ``swings,'' we developed a \textbf{Random Forest (RF) Classifier}. The model utilizes a multi-dimensional feature matrix, including DMS gradients, rally counts, and cumulative point differences. Through leave-one-match-out cross-validation, the model identified that ``current momentum state'' and ``rally length'' are the strongest predictors of impending shifts. The predictive framework achieved a high \textbf{Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.945}, demonstrating superior reliability in early-warning detection of match reversals.

Finally, we performed a \textbf{Sensitivity Analysis} on the decay constant and serve-weight parameters to ensure model stability across diverse match conditions. Our study concludes that while momentum is persistent, it is highly susceptible to ``pivotal points.'' We advise coaches that psychological intervention is most critical during high-rally-count points where DMS gradients fluctuate. The proposed framework is versatile and can be generalized to other point-based sports such as table tennis and volleyball to optimize strategic decision-making.
