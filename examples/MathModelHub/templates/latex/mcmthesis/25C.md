## 2.3 Data Preprocessing
Overviewing the five attachments provided in this study, "data_dictionary", etc and synthesizing the information regarding medal predictions, event counts, and types, one can observe that the scale of information constitutes a small dataset.
...
For attachment 5, we will address missing values in the columns "Code," "Sports Governing Body," and "Year" through interpolation methods and by removing rows or columns that contain missing values.

# 3 Problem 1: Medal Prediction
This study focuses on predicting medal counts for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.
...
SHAP force plots provide insights into the interrelationships and significance of different sports within nations regarding their gold and total medal counts.

## 3.1 Medal Ranking
### 3.1.1 PCA: Reducing Dimensions
In predicting Olympic gold medals and rankings, outcomes are closely linked to the medal counts and compositions from previous Games.
...
This analysis yields five principal component characteristics regarding medal weights of sporting events at the 2020 Olympics through PCA dimensionality reduction.

### 3.1.2 LSTM: Trends Based on Time
Predicting the Olympic medal tally can be framed as a time series forecasting problem, as countries' medal counts show temporal continuity.
...
The process of constructing the LSTM model is as follows.

Feature design: Each country's home advantage coeficient \(\alpha_{c}\) is estimated through regression based on historical data, normalized to serve as weights: **Formula**
A binary variable \(Host _{t} \in{0,1}\) is utilized to indicate whether the country is the host for the year t . A preparatory period effect is introduced to capture the impact of increased investments during the preparation phase: **Formula**
where \(t_{host }\) denotes the year of hosting, and 8 is equivalent to two Olympic cycles.

Input feature reconstruction: The input vector for each time step is expande to: **Formula**

Time series modeling and feature fusion: A dual-channel LSTM structure is employed to separately process the medal sequence and home advantage features, with a final fusion for prediction: **Formula**
where \(n_{steps }=3\) , represents using data from the last three Olympics. represents vector concatenation, FC denotes a fully connected layer and \(\hat{y}_{t}\) is the predictions.

Loss function and joint optimization: A hierarchical loss function is designed to constrain medal predictions and home advantage identification separately: **Formula**
where \(\lambda_{1}=0.7\) . \(\lambda_{2}=0.3\) \(\hat{p}_{i}=0.1\)

In the tuning process for the LSTM model, we primarily focused on two parameters: the number of neurons in the hidden layer (hidden_size) and the number of epochs allowed for early stopping (patience).
...
Therefore, we ultimately determined the parameters to be hidden \(size =128\) and \(patience =10\) . This selection provides critical trends measures for subsequent research involving XGBoost. **Formula**
where w,is the weight of country \(c's\) gold medals or total medals, y,is the true and \(\hat{y}_{c}\) is the prediction.

### 3.1.3 XGBoost-Bootstrap Modeling
Based on the aforementioned PCA dimensionality reduction and LSTM trend measurement, we obtain the input data for XGBoost.
...
By employing this approach, we independently run the constructed XGBoost model 1,000 times, allowing us to calculate the 95% confidence interval for each country's fitted values of gold and total medals based on these iterations.

### 3.1.4 Results Display
The hyperparameter tuning of the predictive models employed RMSE as the evaluation criterion, aimed at selecting the model with the minimum RMSE value (see section 6.2 for a detailed analysis).
...
Similarly, countries like China, Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Uzbekistan are also likely to perform poorly in the next Olympic Games.

## 3.2 Breaking the Zero
Based on the aforementioned analysis and the criteria for achieving a "breakthrough of zero," we identify the countries projected to achieve at least one gold medal in the 2028 Olympics as MKD, BFA, \(TKM,\) KSA, SMR, and KUW.
...
The violin plot in **Fig. 7** illustrates that most of the prediction data for KWT falls within the range of 1 to 2.

Table 3: Sign Rank Sum Test Table
| NOC | w+ | P | pred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GRD | 538231 | 1 | 1 |
| GHA | 532048 | 1 | 1 |
| SMR | 498067 | 0.847 | 2 |
| KWT | 389859 | 0.684 | 1 |
| SAU | 222158 | 0.0011 | 1 |
| | TKM 197115 | 3.01e-09 | |
| | MKD 153243 | 1.22e-26 | |
| BFA | 153243 | 1.22e-26 | |

## 3.3 Olympic Events and Medal Counts
We have chosen to utilize SHAP1.10 analysis tools for the correlation analysis and importance measurement between Olympic events and medal counts.

### 3.3.1 Spearman: A Mathematical Analysis
The Spearman correlation coefficient is a non-parametric measure of rank correlation.
...
This analysis aims to explore the interrelationships between the different sports and their respective gold and medal counts from a mathematical perspective.

### 3.3.2 SHAP: Revealing Correlations and Importance
SHAP is a game theory-based tool that enhances the interpretability of machine learning models.
...
Specifically, by leveraging the SHAP force plot for a single sample, one can observe which sports primarily influence the medal counts of a particular country.

### 3.3.3 Analysis of Relationships and Importance
Based on the formula for the Spearman correlation coefficient and hypothesis testing, sports with non-significant correlation coefficients, such as Wrestling, Beach Volleyball, Handball, Trampoline Gymnastics, and Cycling, were excluded.
...
While France's traditional strengths in these events may not match those of the U.S., home advantage helps bridge the gap.

# 4 Problem 2: The "Great Coach" Effect
It is evident from the problem 2 statement that the mobility of coaches is greater than that of athletes, suggesting that their transfers may have a direct impact on a country's medal performance.
...
Additionally, the uncertainty of the estimates, such as confidence intervals and P -values, should be discussed to enhance the credibility of the conclusions. So we build the following DID model. **Formula**

## 4.1 DID Modeling
The validity of the DID model relies on the parallel trends assumption, which states that the trends in medal counts for the treatment and control groups should be consistent prior to the coaching change.
...
So we build the following DID model. **Formula**

## 4.2 Hypothesis Testing and Contribution Coefficient Analysis
We subsequently fit the model equation using ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the coefficients \(\beta_{0}\) \(\beta_{1}\) , \(\beta_{2}\) , \(\beta_{3}\) , .
...
This aligns with the aforementioned results, suggesting that our model is effective.

Table 4: Results of the DID Model on the Great Coach Effect
| NOC | Sport | B3 | P-value | 95% confidence interval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JPN | Judo | 6.0 | 0.001 | [4.8, 7.2] |

| CHN | Shooting | 3.0 | 0.180 | [-1.2, 7.2] |
| BRA | Skateboarding | 3.0 | 0.250 | [-2.0, 8.0] |

# 5 Problem 3: New Insights
## 5.1 Dynamics of Medal Counts in Space and Time
### 5.1.1 Insight
The model analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of Olympic medal counts through multiple iterations and Bootstrap resampling methods.
...
In contrast, some smaller nations exhibit greater volatility in their medal counts, suggesting that their performance may be heavily influenced by specific events or sudden occurrences.

### 5.1.2 Decision support
The findings can assist the Olympic committees in developing more flexible strategies for future Olympic cycles.
...
Additionally, for countries showing more stable performances, the Olympic committees could focus on maintaining existing advantages while bolstering research and technical support to ensure they remain competitive at the forefront.

## 5.2 Correlation Between Olympic Medal Counts and Specific Events
### 5.2.1 Insight
The model, through the integration of PCA and LSTM, reveals the significance of certain specific events in predicting medal counts.
...
In particular, swimming and athletics stand out as primary sources of medal counts for many nations due to their frequent competitions and high viewer engagement.

### 5.2.2 Decision support
Olympic committees can leverage these analytical findings for strategic planning, paricularly in resource allocation and event development.
...
Furthermore, informed by data analysis, countries can identify potential medal-winning events in advance, enabling them to formulate effective athlete development programs and promotional strategies for these disciplines.

## 5.3 Coaching Investment Directions in National Strategies
### 5.3.1 Insight
Through model analysis, some countries exhibit strong medal returs following coaching changes, as seen in Australia.
...
Conversely, other nations experience minimal impact from such coaching transitions, despite implementing changes.

### 5.3.2 Decision support
Olympic committees should develop personalized strategies based on the specific circumstances of different countries, prioritizing support for events that demonstrate significant improvements post-coaching changes.
...
Meanwhile, for events that show less pronounced results, committees could reduce excessive investments in those coaching staff and reallocate resources to focus on areas more likely to yield medals.

# 6 Sensitivity Analysis
## 6.1 The Number of Principal Components
To simplify the data structure and improve the efficiency of the prediction model, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used.
...
This approach reduces data dimensionality while retaining essential information and eliminating redundant features.

## 6.2 Prediction Model Evaluation
In the model evaluation, we examined both the predictive accuracy and robustness of the gold medal and total medal prediction models.

### 6.2.1 Predictive accuracy
Through 10-fold cross-validation and Bootstrap resampling, we obtained prediction intervals and confidence levels for both models.
...
These results are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5: Model Evaluation Metrics
| | Gold | | Total | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Training | Test | Training | Test |
| MSE | 1.33 | 6.83 | 28.5 | 6.46 |
| RMSE | 1.16 | 2.61 | 5.34 | 2.54 |
| MAE | 1.49 | 0.52 | 3.68 | 1.04 |
| MAPE | 17.50% | 14.47% | 18.63% | 16.13% |

### 6.2.2 Robustness evaluation
To assess the robustness of the model, we focused on the \(R^{2}\) value and the R-squared line plot from 10-fold cross-validation, as shown in **Figs. 17(a)-(b)**.
...
The results showed that both the gold medal and total medal prediction models had \(R^{2}\) values close to 1, indicating that the models fit the data well and demonstrate consistent performance across different datasets, showcasing strong generalizability.

# 7 Model Analysis
## 7.1 Strength
The innovation and advantages of this study lie in the development of a predictive model for Olympic medal counts by integrating the PCA-LSTM-enhanced XGBoostBootstrap algorithm.
...
Furthermore, the combination of PCA for dimensionality reduction and LSTM for trend modeling enhances the predictive accuracy of medal counts, showcasing strong modeling capabilities, particularly in addressing complex nonlinear relationships and time series data.

## 7.2 Weakness and Further Discussion
Our model has several limitations and incompatibilities.
...
By incorporating stochastic simulations, this model will dynamically adjust the effects of coaching changes on medal counts, significantly boosting its adaptability in fluctuating environments and improving overall predictive effectiveness.
